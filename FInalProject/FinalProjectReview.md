  ## What did you learn?
- In the past 4 months, I have learned to create a database, normalize my tables, insert data into those tables and eventually connected to it. I went on to experiement with ASP.NET technologies such as Razor Pages and Views that are controlled by their corresponding controllers. All these components work together to house my data, manipulate the data and evetually display the data to the user in the manner that fulfills the business requirement(s).
- I have learend that software development is not just coding, it really is an involved process where a developer is trying to address the needs of a client through the development and use of software.

  ## What did you do wrong?
  - The biggest mistake I made during the development process of my project was to change the concept with little time left before presenting it. I realized that my original design was ok but had very little functionality and little interaction with my database. This did not accur to me until well into the second phase of the program. If I could do it all over again, I would choose simple, yet solid components to mimic a real life entity such as an online store. All in all, have your design concept ready for development and do not change the project last minute if possible.

  ## Where were you lucky?
  - Simply, I was lucky enough to have great classmates who were willing to take some time out of their day to help me.

  ## What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
  - I would change my design to be an e-commerce site from the very beginning because I found all the components of the SportsStore to be valuable. From creating controllers that interact with my models, to rendering an html output from the Razor view, I felt the SportStore had a lot of good things to work with. I know now that I must create a repository to hold the concept of Orders or even a Cart to hold items for a store. This repositories must be imported into the Razor views that use them just like the imported libraries on top of a .cs file.
